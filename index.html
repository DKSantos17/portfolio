                <p>The following is a simple ten-question quiz about one of my favorite subjects: the Seattle Seahawks. With simple, semantic HTML, CSS, and Javascript (and some help from the JQuery library), this quiz provides the student with continuous feedback and instant bragging rights.</p>

            <p>I am a husband, a father, and a recent graduate of the Full Stack Web Development program at Thinkful. I love crafting the perfect user experience, and solving problems that have never been encountered before. My experience with online learning has given me a passion for creating small web applications, which I love expanding into bigger projects.</p>
            <p>When I’m AFK, I love to spend time with my family, catch a game on TV, and go princess-rescuing on my Switch. I also enjoy making music and brushing up on French, which I speak fluently. Since becoming a dad, I’ve gotten pretty good at multitasking in my free time, but I love getting to tackle a new coding problem with undivided attention.</p>
